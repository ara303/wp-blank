# WordPress, but blank. For developing plugins or themes

I made this for myself primarily so I can easily start with a blank version of WP for when I want to get started developing something quick. I love Underscores.me but I've always wished something like it extended for the rest of WordPress, so I've stripped out everything I know I don't need or want so I can focus on what I do want to make.

Currently version 6.7.1 of WordPress core. 

- The sample posts, pages, and comments removed
- A blank theme (generated by Underscores.me)
- The Classic Editor plugin

## Use
Expand the contents of `blank.zip` into your WP installation directory.

Everything should just workâ„¢.

## Dev environment
Use [Studio](https://developer.wordpress.com/studio/).

A lot of the recommended dev environments kinda suck. dotorg's own [wp-env](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-env/) is... fine, but buggy.

You may also use LocalWP (_really_ slow on Windows!), set up Laravel Herd (kinda needs their Pro premium product to work well because no out of the box MySQL/equivalent support), or Xampp or Mamp if you're weird.

[Studio](https://github.com/Automattic/studio) is undeniably snappy, although unconventional in its implementation, but very much sufficient for plugin or theme development.

Soon, I want to try [ddev](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/#wordpress), which appears to be the most "production-accurate" environment (Docker containers).
