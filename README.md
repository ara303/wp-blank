# WordPress, but blank. For developing plugins or themes

I made this for myself primarily so I can easily start with a blank version of WP for when I want to get started developing something quick. I love Underscores.me but I've always wished something like it extended for the rest of WordPress, so I've stripped out everything I know I don't need or want so I can focus on what I do want to make.

Currently version 6.7.1 of WordPress core.

Has: 

- The sample posts, pages, and comments removed
- A blank theme (generated by Underscores.me)
- The Classic Editor plugin

Doesn't have:
- Anything else, at all

Have fun. ðŸ˜Š
